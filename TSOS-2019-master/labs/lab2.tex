\section{How is Our Console Like a Linux TTY Subsystem?}

The console for the Operating System that we are currently creating can be directly compared to a Linux TTY subsystem. They are both very similar in nature due to their low level qualities and CLI structured interface. For iProject1 we implement many of the commands and keyboard listeners that the linux utilizes. For example, our console is now able to use backspace, clear line, and eventually session management as linux would handle it. Also as a whole, our operating system uses the same virtual low-level hardware (kernel) as an actual linux machine would. Continuing with the project we will eventually be able to run multiple processes simultaneously to increase performance.
