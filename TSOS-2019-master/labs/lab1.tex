\section{Lab Questions}


1) Using the same system call for both I/O devices and file manipulation has both advantages and disadvantages. Merging both together allows for quick system calls and accessing both in the same manner while also allowing APIs to be written for ease of use and code reduction. Some disadvantages include not being able to capture the functionality of similar devices which can potentially negatively affect the performance of the OS.

2) A user should be able to create a new command interpreter using just system calls considering we are able to use the kernel to make requests. Using system calls you can use the shell to manage processes, run scripts, and move files. Using these functionalities through system calls will allow you to eventually create a new interpreter of your shell.
